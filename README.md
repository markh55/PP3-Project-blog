##Devbase

Devbase is to share content and give users the ability to fully interact with it. You can create your own posts, read what others have shared, update your entries, or delete them whenever you like. Whether you're here to write, browse, or both, the goal is to make the experience smooth, enjoyable, and engaging. Dive in and be part of the journey!

## Planning

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to browse and read blog posts created by others so I can engage with their content.

* As a logged-in user, I want to edit my own blog posts so I can update or improve my content.

* As a logged-in user, I want to delete my blog posts so I can remove content I no longer want to share.

* As a user, I want a simple and responsive layout with clear navigation so I can easily find what Iâ€™m looking for.

* As a developer, I want to ensure blog posts are stored in a relational database linked to user accounts so that data is organized and secure.


### Wireframes
With the design the aim was to make it clean and simple for you user to be able to navigate the site with ease, before any coding have taken place i came up with the below wireframe to repesent the vision i had for the project site.

### Welcome Page -

### Colour Scheme


## Final Design

## Deployment 

### Git Hub

with this project all i needed to do on github was create the PP3-Project-blog repository as the main deployment was handled via Heroku (steps below)

### Heroku

First step i did was create the blog-pp3 app within Heroku by creating the app name and ajusting the location to europe, once they was done i clicked create app.

Second step was to navigate to the 'Deploy" tab and link my Github account once that was linked i could then search for my repository i would like to link.

Following on from step two once that was all linking up i go to the bottom of the page and click "deploy now".

Then when they deployment is compeleted it would go back to the top of the page to click "open app" to ensure my project was all linked and working as it should.
