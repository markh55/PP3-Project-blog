## Planning

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to sign up and log in so that I can create and manage my own blog posts.

* As a logged-in user, I want to create a new blog post so that I can share content on the platform.

* As a user, I want to browse and read blog posts created by others so I can engage with their content.

* As a logged-in user, I want to edit my own blog posts so I can update or improve my content.

* As a logged-in user, I want to delete my blog posts so I can remove content I no longer want to share.

* As a user, I want a simple and responsive layout with clear navigation so I can easily find what Iâ€™m looking for.

* As a developer, I want to ensure blog posts are stored in a relational database linked to user accounts so that data is organized and secure.

* As a developer, I want to deploy the project to Heroku so users can access it online easily.

## Deployment 

### Git Hub

with this project all i needed to do on github was create the PP3-Project-blog repository as the main deployment was handled via Heroku (steps below)

### Heroku

First step i did was create the blog-pp3 app within Heroku by creating the app name and ajusting the location to europe, once they was done i clicked create app.

Second step was to navigate to the 'Deploy" tab and link my Github account once that was linked i could then search for my repository i would like to link.

Following on from step two once that was all linking up i go to the bottom of the page and click "deploy now".

Then when they deployment is compeleted it would go back to the top of the page to click "open app" to ensure my project was all linked and working as it should.
