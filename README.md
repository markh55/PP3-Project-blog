## Deployment 

### Git Hub

with this project all i needed to do on github was create the PP3-Project-blog repository as the main deployment was handled via Heroku (steps below)

### Heroku

First step i did was create the blog-pp3 app within Heroku by creating the app name and ajusting the location to europe, once they was done i clicked create app.

Second step was to navigate to the 'Deploy" tab and link my Github account once that was linked i could then search for my repository i would like to link.
