with this project all i needed to do on github was create the PP3-Project-blog repository as the main deployment was handled via Heroku (steps below)

### Heroku

First step i did was create the blog-pp3 app within Heroku by creating the app name and ajusting the location to europe, once they was done i clicked create app.

Second step was to navigate to the 'Deploy" tab and link my Github account once that was linked i could then search for my repository i would like to link.

Following on from step two once that was all linking up i go to the bottom of the page and click "deploy now".

Then when they deployment is compeleted it would go back to the top of the page to click "open app" to ensure my project was all linked and working as it should.
